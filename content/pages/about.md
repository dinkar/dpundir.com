Loves hiking, dancing and engineering stuff. Enjoys throwing water at cats and watch them jump in fury. Presently building frontend applications at [Zalando](https://zalando.de) in Berlin. Former frontend/fullstack artisan for [VWO](https://vwo.com/) and [PushCrew](https://pushcrew.com/) at [Wingify Software](https://wingify.com/). All views here are my own.
